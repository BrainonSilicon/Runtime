# Run! For Runtime (powered by Al Gore-rithm)

SSI Hack Day project: Run! For Runtime

## Why

There is a disconnect between users of compute (in particular, high resource users in research who are increasingly nudged towards using generative AI for simple tasks) and the resources used to enable that compute. A user runs a job and waits for the output. But "hidden" labour, material resources, and energetics underpin all compute. This games brings that the surface, and prompts users to consider [the proportionality - or otherwise](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/digital-technology-and-the-planet/) - of their compute actions.
