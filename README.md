# Run! For Runtime

SSI Hack Day project: Run! For Runtime

## Why

There is a disconnect between users of compute (in particular, high resource users in research) and the resources used to enable that compute. A user runs a job and waits for the output. But "hidden" labour, material resources, and energetics underpin all compute. This games brings that the surface, and prompts users to consider [the proportionality - or otherwise](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/digital-technology-and-the-planet/) - of their compute actions.
