# Runtime
SSI Hack Day project: Making Runtime Run

## Why

There is a disconnect between users of compute and the resources used to enable that computer. A user runs a job and waits for the output. But "hidden" material resources and energetics underpin all compute. This games brings that the surface, and prompts users to consider [the proportionality - or otherwise](https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/digital-technology-and-the-planet/) - of their compute actions.
